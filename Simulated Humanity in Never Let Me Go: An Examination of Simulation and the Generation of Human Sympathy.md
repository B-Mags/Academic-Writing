“Poor creatures. What did we do to you? With all our schemes and plans?” asks Madame
Marie-Claude mid-crisis-of-conscience in Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go (Ishiguro 254).
The novel delivers us a dystopian late-nineties England characterized by a special brand of
fatalism reserved for the lowest class of society, a class comprised of clones, raised from infancy,
created for medical research and advancement—the “creatures” to which Madame refers
(Ishiguro 254). These clones are initially presented to the reader as humans, children studying at
a specialized school. It’s only as they age and enter a world in which they are expected to donate
vital organs to ailing humans do we grasp any inhumanity previously—and purposefully—
obscured by the narration. The text urges us to examine humanity, to consider what the definition
of being a human entails, whether there is any grey area. It asks us to look closely at who holds
the power in labeling others. We watch as the clones simulate human behavior, sympathize with
one another, both eliciting and experiencing human emotions, and through this process, the
clones exhibit an auto-genetic humanity within themselves which makes them no different from
a human biologically born. <br>
Never Let Me Go is a memoir of the Other. It’s a culmination of the experiences of thirty-
one-year-old Kathy H., a Hailsham-student-turned-Carer—a figure situated in one of the lowest
societal positions in Ishiguro’s imagined counter-fiction. But why is it these students of Hailsham
—our protagonist, Kathy and her friends, Tommy, Ruth, and the lot—are considered Others?
What makes us as readers, along with the teachers of Hailsham and those of the wider world,
question the students’ humanity? Ishiguro withholds the word “clone” until over halfway through
the novel, until a moment of heartbreak during which Ruth reveals some of her greatest fears:
“We all know it. We’re modeled from trash. Junkies, prostitutes, winos, tramps. Convicts
maybe…” she says before going on to talk about her own “possible,” her “clone model”
(Ishiguro 166). In this moment, we understand, to some extent, where the students come from—
their origin of existence. In an instant, despite what we’ve learned about the characters to this
point, despite our inability to know just how organic each clone is, we no longer assign them the
word human, but rather clone—a species altogether different and if not entirely, at least partly
inhuman. From this point forward, the students of Hailsham are defined not by what they are, but
by what they are not. <br>
