### Simulated Humanity in Never Let Me Go:
### An Examination of Simulation and the Generation of Human Sympathy

“Poor creatures. What did we do to you? With all our schemes and plans?” asks Madame
Marie-Claude mid-crisis-of-conscience in Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go (Ishiguro 254).
The novel delivers us a dystopian late-nineties England characterized by a special brand of
fatalism reserved for the lowest class of society, a class comprised of clones, raised from infancy,
created for medical research and advancement—the “creatures” to which Madame refers
(Ishiguro 254). These clones are initially presented to the reader as humans, children studying at
a specialized school. It’s only as they age and enter a world in which they are expected to donate
vital organs to ailing humans do we grasp any inhumanity previously—and purposefully—
obscured by the narration. The text urges us to examine humanity, to consider what the definition
of being a human entails, whether there is any grey area. It asks us to look closely at who holds
the power in labeling others. We watch as the clones simulate human behavior, sympathize with
one another, both eliciting and experiencing human emotions, and through this process, the
clones exhibit an auto-genetic humanity within themselves which makes them no different from
a human biologically born. <br>
<br>
Never Let Me Go is a memoir of the Other. It’s a culmination of the experiences of thirty-
one-year-old Kathy H., a Hailsham-student-turned-Carer—a figure situated in one of the lowest
societal positions in Ishiguro’s imagined counter-fiction. But why is it these students of Hailsham
—our protagonist, Kathy and her friends, Tommy, Ruth, and the lot—are considered Others?
What makes us as readers, along with the teachers of Hailsham and those of the wider world,
question the students’ humanity? Ishiguro withholds the word “clone” until over halfway through
the novel, until a moment of heartbreak during which Ruth reveals some of her greatest fears:
“We all know it. We’re modeled from trash. Junkies, prostitutes, winos, tramps. Convicts
maybe…” she says before going on to talk about her own “possible,” her “clone model”
(Ishiguro 166). In this moment, we understand, to some extent, where the students come from—
their origin of existence. In an instant, despite what we’ve learned about the characters to this
point, despite our inability to know just how organic each clone is, we no longer assign them the
word human, but rather clone—a species altogether different and if not entirely, at least partly
inhuman. From this point forward, the students of Hailsham are defined not by what they are, but
by what they are not. <br> 
<br>
And so what *are* these Hailsham students, then? What aren’t they? How do we define
them? Donna Haraway’s definition of the “cyborg,” with which “modern medicine” is lousy,
seems to fit most neatly; she writes, “A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and
organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction” (Haraway 5). The definition
is two-pronged: First, it addresses the biological state of the students, who are, as we find out
roughly halfway through the narrative, copied from humans—or, to define humans more
specifically, those biologically conceived—for the sole purpose of organ donation. The clones
experience a “replication,” as Haraway explains—distinctly not a birth, “uncoupled from the
organic reproduction” (Haraway 6). This is the line drawn between the two: sexual conception
versus scientific creation, both technically manmade, but one organic (humans), the other
inorganic (clones). Here lies our binary, the impetus for the novel’s, and reader’s, Othering of the
clones, a group imbued with inferiority by the majority and attributed a baseness created not by
the cyborg or their existence, but rather imposed on them by the cyborg’s oppressors. <br>
<br>
The second piece of Haraway’s definition is the further explication: the cyborg as a
“creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction,” in other words, the cyborg’s
simultaneous, and co-mingling, humanity and inhumanity, where humanity is real and tangibly
exists in our “social reality” and inhumanity is fiction (Haraway 5). This speaks to the cyborg’s
place in the world, in our society as a whole. In order to address this question of realness—to
truly determine the ratio of humanity to inhumanity within the clones—we must then determine
the unit of measurement. If the definition of humanity is exhibited by existing within “social
reality,” then it follows the measurement of such is social function and behavior within that
reality (Haraway 5). <br>
<br>
Let us take, then, Jean Baudrillard’s definitions for simulation and dissimilation into
consideration to better understand the clones’ behaviors. He states, “To dissimilate is to pretend
not to have what one has. To simulate is to feign to have what one doesn’t have” (Baudrillard 3).
It is imperative to note that “only simulation threatens the difference between the ‘true’ and the
‘false,’ the ‘real’ and the ‘imaginary’” (Baudrillard 3). While dissimilation is incapable of
altering reality because it creates only an absence in the world, simulation, by Baudrillard’s
definition, has the ability to psychosomatically produce symptoms, which create “a real without
origin or reality: a hyperreal” (Baudrillard 3). This hyperreality, as he describes it, “becomes
more than the reality itself and assumes independent value” (Cuddon 347). What I’d like to
examine here are the clones’ relationships and attachments, their thoughts and sympathetic
interactions, their emotions—the symptoms generated by their simulation of human behavior—
along with the summation of all these, the created “hyperreal:” their souls and thus their
humanity (Baudrillard 1). <br>
<br>
I would like to first concentrate on the clones’ shared childhood—that time before they
were burdened with their fate, before they, or we as readers, knew the word clone. Hailsham
House is itself an experiment, a sort of Civil Rights “movement” as it’s called by Miss Emily,
intended to improve conditions under which the clones are raised (Ishiguro 263). Hailsham
mirrors the image and experience of a traditional, perhaps even upperclass, boarding school,
where clone children are fostered in an educational environment that encourages the
manifestation of emotions as art in order to prove that there’s enough humanity in the clones to
warrant the better treatment. The teachers elicit emotions in the students by teaching them to
simulate typical human behavior. The school provides a space for the clones to interact with one
another, to form relationships, to learn and experience growth and change, all with the hope that
they demonstrate their ability to experience emotions. <br>
<br>
The narrative opens with an explosion of complex feeling demonstrated by multiple
clones in an intricate social interaction, which illustrates this idea of behavior simulation creating
symptoms of humanity. The reader witnesses myriad simulated behaviors, which work both in
conjunction with and against one another: The boys, about to start a game, choose teams,
singling out Tommy in order to hurt his feelings; the girls watch from above and gossip about the
interaction. These actions elicit various emotional responses from the individual clones. Tommy
D., in a fit of rage, “raving, flinging his limbs about, at the sky, at the wind, at the nearest fence
post,” rails against the boys who pick on him (Ishiguro 10). Ruth, grappling with her feelings of
guilt for betraying a close friend and the pressure to fit in, remarks, “I suppose it is a bit cruel
[…] but it’s his own fault” and goes on to tease Tommy with the rest of the girls (Ishiguro 10).
Kathy, most markedly, though she doesn’t seem to fully understand what is compelling her,
shows compassion; she demonstrates the ability to sympathize with Tommy in going to him and
offering kindness. <br>
<br>
As the clones age into their teens, the instances of simulation, and the types of
relationships they experience, become more complicated, more nuanced, and, consequently,
more explicit. “Out there, we had to behave like them. We had to follow the rules…” a young
Kathy notes as she digests first-time information about sex and what defines a sexual relationship
(Ishiguro 84). She directly addresses this necessity to maintain an established normalcy, which,
in part and along with many other behaviors and emotions, defines what it is to be human.
Suddenly, there is a new sense of immediacy and importance. There’s a new weight given to the
significance of necessary and appropriate simulation. For the first time, the reader becomes
aware of the greater stakes at play. We can see now that the clones must fit into the human world
in a particular way. Later, after Kathy moves to the Cottages and experiences sex in the real
world, she notes, “The sex had done funny things to my feelings, just as Miss Emily had warned”
(Ishiguro 128). This example of nurture versus nature, the taught behavior, elicits the same
reality that would be produced in a biological human: a confusing sexual interaction—the
simulated behavior—creates feelings of inadequacy and insecurity—the symptom. <br>
<br>
Through all of this coming-of-age, the teachers of Hailsham insist that the clones utilize
their emotions to create pieces of art, providing them both catharsis and validation through
accomplishment. Beyond the practice of art, the teachers encourage distinction in art through the
concept of the Gallery, a mysterious collection into which only the finest of the students’ work is
absorbed for later purposes. The Gallery serves as a sort of origin-of-myth. Because the clones
are not privy to the reason for the Gallery’s existence, rumors run rampant. Most specifically,
they theorize that the Gallery is meant to illustrate who they are on a deeper level, so that when
the time comes, if they are truly in love, they may request a deferral of donations. To the clones,
the Gallery provides the necessary evidence to reveal what they “are like inside,” to reveal their
“souls” (Ishiguro 175). In essence, to the clones, the Gallery exists to confirm their humanity. <br>
<br>
With the Hailsham House experiment, the guardians built into the clones the capacity for
love, for sympathy, and thus fostered the clones’ ability to present souls. The Gallery gives them
hope; it allows them to engage with faith in salvation. It also drives them to continue to create.
This continued creation—this simulation—only proliferates the clones’ emotions—the symptoms
of the simulation—which compound and ultimately contribute, with more strength, to the
hyperreal self thus bolstering the argument for their innate humanity. Even the negation of their
hope, Miss Emily’s proclamation that the Gallery exists to “prove they had souls at all,” a
semantic difference from the clones’ explication of the Gallery that should not go unnoticed,
serves to elicit human emotions (Ishiguro 260). This admission engenders in Kathy and Tommy
an overwhelming grief, a feeling of loss and despair, because they know they are going to lose
each other, that their time is severely limited, and they have no way to stop any of it. <br>
<br>
The most marked and pertinent example of human behavior simulation, however, is the
book itself, this memoir of the Other, a fictional autobiography penned by our protagonist, Kathy,
which reinforces the existence of her humanity on a structural level. It’s a self-reflection, an
analysis of Kathy’s grief over the loss of her childhood, and ultimately her life along with the
lives of her friends, and all the ways she and the other clones experience that grief differently and
to different capacities. We’ve looked at the grief, the emotions engendered by all these captured
scenarios, but now let’s shift the lens. Let’s look at the structure of the autobiography and what
its metafictionality says about those emotions and their culmination. <br>
<br>
Heidi Pennington points out that the fictional autobiography mirrors the “same cognitive
activities as getting to know another person in the real world: filling in gaps, assigning
motivations, and working both with and against the declarations of the autobiographer herself to
generate a sense of her complex identity” (Pennington 4). Kathy curates her life story,
manipulates the narrative, the same way any person might in reality when presenting themselves.
In the examination of story versus discourse, the fictional autobiography allows us to see a sort
of self-creation in which Kathy practices “strategic withholding” (Pennington 4). She is the
reader’s sole source and as such holds absolute power over the discourse. That is, she alone
decides how to organize the narrative by choosing which pieces of her story are told and by
manipulating the order in which those pieces are given to the reader. Kathy actively highlights
what she wants the reader to see, feel, and understand. It is no coincidence that the word clone
doesn’t appear in the first half of the narrative. “Silence at the level of the story empowers her
speech at the level of the discourse;” that is, Kathy is empowered by her ability to let the reader
assume she is human until she is ready to present herself as a clone—until she’s provided enough
information for the reader to have conflicting feelings about the definition of humanity
(Pennington 1). Instead of guiding the reader in a direction where they must prove that she is
human, Kathy guides the reader in a different direction, one that forces the reader to prove she
*isn’t* a human. This process of “identity-narration” allows Kathy to create the self she is
presenting to the reader (Pennington 5). <br>
<br>
In addition to presenting this human self, Kathy aligns her experience with the reader’s
own. Her persistent acknowledgement of the reader “initiates a pattern of audience inclusion in
which readers are encouraged or provoked by the mode of narration to perceive the role they
play in creating” her “textual self” (Pennington 4). Kathy’s particular brand of reader address,
her strategic use of “you,” works on multiple levels. While it pulls in and includes the reader, it
also implies that the reader is the very same as Kathy herself. At the beginning of chapter two,
we read “I don’t know how it was where you were, but…” (Ishiguro 13). This acknowledgement,
which we come across several times throughout the story, widens the world, implies that there
are more places than simply Hailsham and that those places extend out into our reality beyond
the fictional world, but—and possibly more importantly—it equalizes the reader and the
narrator; Kathy assumes the reader is the same as her. This sameness, along with the intimate
feeling of being told a story directly, creates a close aesthetic distance, which ultimately
contributes to the narrative’s, and Kathy’s self’s, verisimilitude. It augments Kathy’s humanity
and puts the reader on the same plane as the character, making the process of sympathizing
significantly more accessible. <br>
<br>
If the simulated human behavior in question is Kathy’s practice of autobiography, then
the symptom is her ability to sympathize. Autobiography takes place after-the-fact; it’s a
reflection on one’s life, a recreated image of past scenarios. Its strength lies in its critical nature,
in Kathy’s ability to explore what those scenarios meant to her in the past and what they now
mean to her in the present. The reader is able to examine, along with Kathy, the dissonance
between those two meanings. This is clearly illustrated when Kathy says, “But when I think
about it now, I can see things more from Ruth’s viewpoint. I can see, for instance, how she might
have felt I had been the one to first violate an understanding, and that her little dig had just been
a retaliation” (Ishiguro 129). This moment extends beyond understanding; it’s an illustration of
“fellow-feeling” (Greiner 3). <br>
<br>
In “Thinking of Me Thinking of You,” Rae Greiner expands on Adam Smith’s thesis on
sympathy, she summarizes: “Sympathy is a way of thinking about others, not an embodiment of
their emotions, and not reserved for sorrow” (Greiner 3). She goes on to explain that sympathy is
a cognitive process, one in which the reader considers the character’s situation and then imagines
herself inside that situation, explores what emotions that situation may engender within herself.
The reader then compares her emotions to those which the character exhibits. Kathy displays this
ability with regularity; it’s what makes her an exemplary Carer. The fictional autobiographical
form of the novel allows us to not only examine these instances of sympathetic interaction, but
also consider the narrative as a whole as an act of sympathy. <br>
<br>
In this instance, returning to Baudrillard’s theory, examining Never Let Me Go as a
fictional autobiography, we are able to define Kathy’s innate humanity in a series of three steps:
1) Kathy simulates the human behavior of autobiographical writing. 2) The symptom of this
behavior is Kathy’s ability to sympathize—her ability to assess her own feelings juxtaposed
against those of others and, further, her ability to engender emotions and sympathy within the
reader. 3) This exhibited sympathy and all it entails—this symptom of simulation—along with
other human emotions, including the ability to love and grieve and reminisce, contributes to the
overall hyperreality: Kathy’s soul—her humanity—which, as Baudrillard posits, “takes on an
independent value,” one that can be compared to the humanity of a biologically born human, an
“independent value” that may even supplant that humanity to which we are comparing it. In
brief: Kathy, a clone—a cyborg, is human because she was nurtured as such; she possesses
humanity. <br>
<br>
“I’m sure somewhere in your childhood, you too had an experience like ours that day;
similar if not in the actual details, then inside, in the feelings…” Kathy H. propounds, “One day,
maybe not so long from now, you’ll get to know how it feels” (Ishiguro 36). Fellow-feeling
reigns in Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go. It’s the driving force of each relationship in the novel, and
it’s what ultimately helps the students of Hailsham, Kathy and her friends, navigate all the world
holds for them as well as their fate. It’s the very source of their humanity: this ability to interact
with one another on an emotional level, to hurt and despair, to experience joy and love. It
inspires in them the will to live. It makes them human. <br>
